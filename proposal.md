# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

X Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A bot for X/Twitter that uploads posts consitently at a certain hour or pace.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am planning on making the bot post random facts daily or song lyrics daily, although this may change. I am going to use X API, Python, and Tweepy to accomplish this. I am unsure if I will be able to complete it, as it is out of my current comfort zone. I was thinking of having it upload song lyrics daily, so I will pre-pick those out as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be getting atleast half done.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Atleast make a working bot.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make a working bot that follows all the tasks instructed.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps would be to find out how to implement Twitter and Tweepy into Python. I will probably need to research how to do this and how to use Tweepy and aquire those skills. When I figure out how to do this I can start working on the project.
